<h1> Happy 2nd Birthday to BeffsBrowser! </h1>

<p>
To all BeffsBrowser supporters:

I currently have no clue on how many downloads there are, but on Codeplex there was a very nice user base. And I am very joyful for that!  I want to take the time to thank you, for supporting open source, and my
project, from me, to you thank you. And I look forward to another anniversary!
