#BeffsBrowser

You will notice I have moved a lot to the "Old" folder as I am preparing the new BeffsBrowser, to be redesigned, and improved. 

#BeffsEasyNotes

I have a demo of how to use the RichTextBoxPrintCtrl at https://github.com/jdc20181/RichTextDemo

This will prevent clutter in the BeffsBrowser Respo. 

#Development

The things you can do to help are create issues add any code you think that can improve it and await aproval*.
*I have the right to dismiss delete, merge,unmerge,remerge, and so forth to anything placed in this respo.
