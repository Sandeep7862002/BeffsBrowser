#Introducing WebsiteEditor for BeffsBrowser!

This is just like any other editror, sort of. It is in beta and has plans to make it's way actively into a future version of BeffsBrowser.
Features are limited and the base of this project actually comes from a "Issue" I found while researching MDI forms.

#Limited Beta Features

As mentioned before it won't be doing much, but will do plenty to help out!

-Basic Code View (Kinda messy)

More info is to come!
