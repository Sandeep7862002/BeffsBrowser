#Announcment - License Changes

After a long consideration, I have decided to change the license to MIT, the switch will be seamless and info is found in the official [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/License-Changes-Effective-Version-1.6.2)

These Changes are effective as of 1.6.2 and are seamless. 

#Version 1.6.1


*Update has been released early!*

New Trouble Shooting [wiki] (https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Clearing-Data-and-restoring-data) Solution!
I got all of the items listed in the changelog except the Xbox controller support which will come around soon!

I am going to begin working on a new release and will be ready by early March, the main thing is to fix some annoying errors, address some bad practices, and add a app cache system - And I also want to add Xbox Controller support for some of the features within BeffsBrowser. 

More information can be found in the offical [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/First-Update-of-the-new-year!)

I added a [Update Article ] (https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/1.6.1-Release-Announcment) on the release of 1.6.1
Version 1.6.1 change log can be found below:

Happy Holidays!!!

BeffsBrowser will be getting a update soon! I am almost done with just about everything there is mentioned <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.6.1-Coming-Soon">Here</a> and will let you know when the update is ready!

You can also check for updates by hitting the Version Label on the ToolBar in-App and choose "Check for updates" if updates are availalbe a button will show for you to download the new zip. Remember to Close out BeffsBrowser, and uninstall the previous verions. 



#Version 1.6.0 Has been Released!



The update is jammed packed with many things that will improve overall stability and functioning of BeffsBrowser. 

The issues with navigation are pending fix - as I think upgrading the under the hood component will fix that issue. 

Many bugs - additions and improvments have been made - 

#Bugs!

There are quite a few issues going on - some of which will take some time to come up with a plan to fix. 

See that list <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Current-Issues-With-BeffsBrowser">Here</a>
#The New Website Has Been Launched!

Head on over to http://beffsbrowser.tk and check it out!

You may experience issues in BeffsBrowser loading the site, it seems it isn't loading correctly. This will be fixed ASAP However, it will work like it is suppose to. Just scroll down to find the menu.

#version 1.6.0 

Since 1.5.4 was released with most of the new stuff, I thought that it may be best to do the rest with version 1.6.0 

see the <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.6.0">Full log </a> for details.



#Version 1.5.4 

Updated and ready to roll- 

Unzip > Locate Windows installer > Open follow instructions > Go to your start panel and under all apps, if on windows 8.1 you will see it as a newly installed program, open it and BeffsBrowser will launch. 

#Official Website Redesign!
A friend and I are working to get a new updated site put together. There you can get the latest release with a click of a button, FAQ answered and more. 


#Version 1.5.4 *Coming soon!*

*Final 1.5.0 Version*

A new version is now going into development with 1.5.3 released. I need to make sure users can install Version 1.5.3, before I begin working. With that in mind and the log list of items I am working on for this version, it could be as late as December before I finish with this release. 
See the full log on the next release <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.5.4">here</a>
#Version 1.5.3 

I am going to be doing a quick fix release sometime this week or next. This will be my only attempt in the short term future to deal with the .exe don't work bug, as I said in the issue, I really have no intentions on fixing it any time soon as long as the zip works. 

See the Log <a href = "https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.5.3-Bug-fixes-Patch-Release">Here</a>

The Patch Release may not be ready till next week. I have a few more things to do.
#Version 1.5.2 

To get the update you will need to get the zip the .exe will not work. see this <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/issues/3">issue</a> for details. 
It has been released!

What will be in the next update:
