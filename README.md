# Announcments

**Release is almost ready!**

There is a few features that I just added that needs to have some Shortcuts added, and other different things a like. 

I will have some more updates on things changing soon, I also updated the wiki article below talking about the URL box shortcut changes.

**Changes to Url Box Shortcuts**

Some changes are coming for the "Right click paste" Shortcut that has been around for some time. This change will be effective immediately. 

[wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/URL-Box-ShortCut-Changes)

Updates will be posted in the wiki when available.

**Archives will be discontinued for old versions**

All older versions than a set interval will be removed. This come as Codeplex one of the first hosting places for this project is shutting down. While they are going into a read only basis, that is not withstanding the test of time of the open source inititive. So to uphold my respects to and being a member of the open source community archives from Codeplex will be removed perminantly. These are unstable and useless anyhow. You will not see any change or reflection of archives here on the github site or future archives. 


**Good news!**

The Gecko Engine is now in BeffsBrowser. All is running smoothly!


**Version 2.0 Planned release is June 24th**

For now it is planned for June 24th, but it may take extra time or all features may not be in the release. I am also adding Birthday Celebration designs. These will be removed in a small patch update which may include missing features, and other misc fixes. 

Expect the 2.0.1 Release in July sometime - The Birthday Celebrations will last until after BB's Birthday on July 4th. 

Because of the holiday I am releasing it earlier than the Birthday date of BB

# System Requirements!

**As of Version 1.6.2 these are the latest system requirements**

*Minimum Requirements*

  - Windows 7 (XP OR VISTA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED!)

  - 200 MB of storage space + 1GB for data storage (See below for details)

  - 1GB of Ram
  
*Recommended*

Windows 7 or newer (Developed on Windows 8.1)

500 MB of storage space for the applications and keep around 1-2 GB free for data storage (Favorites, History etc)

1 GB of Ram or larger (I have 4GB on my machine so have at least that for best performance)

**Additonal Space may be required**

Depending on how many websites you save, how many sites you visit, and how often you clear that data, you will need to have  alittle more space open. 
I estimated so HIGH because, I simply can't predict how much you will use. It really varies, if you don't navigate a bunch or clear history regularly, then you will have no issues using less than 1mb of space for that data.

**Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported.**

These are both very old Window's Versions both of which are getting the plug pulled by Microsoft or already have. 

BeffsBrowser *may* work but it isn't guaranteed, as it uses a newer framework.
