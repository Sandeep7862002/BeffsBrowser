# Announcments

~~**Beta Testing Launch Scheduled Soon!**~~

~~See the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/BeffsBrowser-Beta-Edition-Details) for details.~~

Cancelled. Due to some issues it isn't going to be possible. Too many security risks with Webkit and Cefsharp isn't working properly so development **ONLY ON THE BETA VERSION** is going to be ceased. Again it will NOT be released.


**Version 2.0 Planned release is June 24th**

For now it is planned for June 24th, but it may take extra time or all features may not be in the release. I am also adding Birthday Celebration designs. These will be removed in a small patch update which may include missing features, and other misc fixes. 

Expect the 2.0.1 Release in July sometime - The Birthday Celebrations will last until after BB's Birthday on July 4th. 

Because of the holiday I am releasing it earlier than the Birthday date of BB



**Version 1.6.3 has been released**

# System Requirements!

**As of Version 1.6.2 these are the latest system requirements**

*Minimum Requirements*

  - Windows 7 (XP OR VISTA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED!)

  - 200 MB of storage space + 1GB for data storage (See below for details)

  - 1GB of Ram
  
*Recommended*

Windows 7 or newer (Developed on Windows 8.1)

500 MB of storage space for the applications and keep around 1-2 GB free for data storage (Favorites, History etc)

1 GB of Ram or larger (I have 4GB on my machine so have at least that for best performance)

**Additonal Space may be required**

Depending on how many websites you save, how many sites you visit, and how often you clear that data, you will need to have  alittle more space open. 
I estimated so HIGH because, I simply can't predict how much you will use. It really varies, if you don't navigate a bunch or clear history regularly, then you will have no issues using less than 1mb of space for that data.

**Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported.**

These are both very old Window's Versions both of which are getting the plug pulled by Microsoft or already have. 

BeffsBrowser *may* work but it isn't guaranteed, as it uses a newer framework.
