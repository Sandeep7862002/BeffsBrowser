**Update to be delayed, Windows 10 Version of BeffsBrowser in Development during the delay*

Due to issues with VS and the migration from VS13 to VS17, I will be delaying the patch update, but no worries! I am going to begin development on the Exclusive Windows 10 Version that I had planned for sometime now. If you have windows 10, you will be able to enjoy BeffsBrowser's New Exclusive version just for Windows 10 users. 

The first launch is expected sometime next month, I will have the new patch update released soon. 

After this launch, Windows 7 users will no longer be able to use BeffsBrowser. This move comes as a forced option to continuing the dev. of this project.


*Some general information*

Will you be able to run the "Windows 10" Version of BeffsBrowser on older versions of windows. 

Yes, Windows 8, and 8.1 will get to continue using it, however, some features maybe disabled or not available. More details are to come. 



**Now being Developed on Windows 10!**

Starting this next release, upgrades to the .NET framework will change the requirements for BeffsBrowser, once this change is in effect, some versions of Windows will be unsupported. I appologize to any inconvience and plan to continue supporting all Windows 7 or Newer versions until discontinued by Microsoft.

Thanks for being a valuable member to the open source community!


**Version 2.1 Patch Release to come next month sometime**

See all the notes in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.1.0-Patch-Release-Coming-Soon!)

**Notice Feature was removed because of transition**

I removed the SSL Lock Feature for the time being - More information on the replacement will be released later. 

**Re-Release is ready!**

Since it was so minor, I simply removed the Old release.The new release solves the issue. 

**Happy Birthday to BB!**

Here is a [Birthday](https://jdc20181.github.io/BeffsBrowser/Birthday.html) Message from myself, celebrating BBs' 2nd birthday!


**New System Requirements**

These may be subject to change before the release, this is because the new browser engine has a few more dependencies than the old, so it is going to need a little more room to breathe.

These are both very old Window's Versions both of which are getting the plug pulled by Microsoft or already have. 

BeffsBrowser *may* work but it isn't guaranteed, as it uses a newer framework.
