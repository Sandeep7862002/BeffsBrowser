# Announcments

**Arcade Feature is being depreciated!**

A Depreciation Life Cycle and the reason behind this is explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Depreciation-of-Arcade-Moving-BeffsBrowser-Forward)


**Version 2.2 Announcment**

Again I appologize in advance but Version 2.2.0 will need to be downloaded manually, and BB 2.1 will have to be uninstalled manually. After this time you will not have to manually uninstall anymore.

Expected release is Sometime in August, I will have more details soon!



**Version 2.2 will be coming soon!**

Development on the next release has begun, in the next release you will need to uninstall one last time, as I am switching to a professional version of the installer, provided for open source projects by Advance Installer. 

This should be the last time you will need to do this - after which you will be able to install updates. 


*Feature Overview*

The biggest highlights of this upcoming update include:

- Start Page enhancments
- Private Browsing Upgrades 
- Bug Fixes (a few major ones)
- More Control over tabs.

And many more misc things!

All the details of the next release are in this [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.2-Coming-Soon).
