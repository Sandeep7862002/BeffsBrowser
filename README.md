# Announcments

**Pre-Release Testing**

Testing for V. 2.4.2 will begin with a Pre-Release that is partially incomplete, and does not include all of the things listed for the update. The test will include the new update system, but will not include the core (which uses a different method of checking for updates). After the upgrade to the updates system I will push a new update approx. 7 days, and will be an additional Test release. These will be labeled as "Version 2.4.2A B C etc" If it takes 20 test updates to inquire consisitancy as well as accuracy and security - it will be so. The "Core" upgrades to the updates system will begin being pushed in the OFFICIAL Release of 2.4.2. You will not need to update to the new version if you do not wish to. More info will come soon!

**Development Delays:**

*update* BeffsBrowser will get an update very soon to push the new updating mechanism, and much more! Sorry for the delays! 

The next release will be scheduled near the Beginning of April at the EARLIEST. This release is going to take extra time due to some of the new core features being added. 




**Version 2.4.0 has been released, 2.4.2 is undergoing development**

Version 2.4.2 will include much that wasn't included in 2.4.0, as well as a bunch of other new features and fixes. [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.4.2)



**Version 2.4.0 has began development**

There is more time for much of the todo list to be completed in 2.4.2, due to an installer issue the "installed" version will display as 2.4.1.

There is already a long to-do list, you can view that in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.4.0)

V. 2.4 is focused on making BB stable and more reliable as well as improvements and new features.
