# Announcments

**Re-Release is ready!**

Since it was so minor, I simply removed the release.The new release solves the issue. 

**Happy Birthday to BB!**

Here is a [Birthday](https://jdc20181.github.io/BeffsBrowser/Birthday.html) Message from myself, celebrating BBs' 2nd birthday!

**Updated Source Tree**

The New source code has been added, I removed any unneccessary code e.g. opening another feature etc. Only the much needed code is given. 


**Temp. Removal of some features**

Due to the transition of the Browser Engine - some things aren't going to be available Temporarily. I will let you know if this changes.

Currently there is no gurantee this will be solved before release. The following will become unavailable:

- Print Preview

Sorry for any inconvience, these are things I am currently working on resolving. 


**New System Requirements**

These may be subject to change before the release, this is because the new browser engine has a few more dependencies than the old, so it is going to need a little more room to breathe.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/System-Requirements)

**Release is almost ready!**

There is a few features that I just added that needs to have some Shortcuts added, and other different things a like. 

I will have some more updates on things changing soon, I also updated the wiki article below talking about the URL box shortcut changes.

**Changes to Url Box Shortcuts**

Some changes are coming for the "Right click paste" Shortcut that has been around for some time. This change will be effective immediately. 

[wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/URL-Box-ShortCut-Changes)

Updates will be posted in the wiki when available.

**Archives will be discontinued for old versions**

All older versions than a set interval will be removed. This come as Codeplex one of the first hosting places for this project is shutting down. While they are going into a read only basis, that is not withstanding the test of time of the open source inititive. So to uphold my respects to and being a member of the open source community archives from Codeplex will be removed perminantly. These are unstable and useless anyhow. You will not see any change or reflection of archives here on the github site or future archives. 


**Good news!**

The Gecko Engine is now in BeffsBrowser. All is running smoothly!


**Version 2.0 Planned release is June 24th**

For now it is planned for June 24th, but it may take extra time or all features may not be in the release. I am also adding Birthday Celebration designs. These will be removed in a small patch update which may include missing features, and other misc fixes. 

Expect the 2.0.1 Release in July sometime - The Birthday Celebrations will last until after BB's Birthday on July 4th. 

Because of the holiday I am releasing it earlier than the Birthday date of BB
