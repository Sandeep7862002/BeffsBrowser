# Announcments

**Source Code Update**

I updated the source code, and officially released the source code for private browsing. Things that are in development aren't released until functional. A new policy is being created to explain the concept and reasons behind this. 

Thanks!


**Back up and running**

I am back to work! I got the issue resolved, it resolved by itself, so I am back at it, working on the next release. Expect this release within the first couple weeks in August. 




**Version 2.2 will be coming soon!**

Development on the next release has begun, in the next release you will need to uninstall one last time, as I am switching to a professional version of the installer, provided for open source projects by Advance Installer. 

This should be the last time you will need to do this - after which you will be able to install updates. 


*Feature Overview*

The biggest highlights of this upcoming update include:

- Start Page enhancments
- Private Browsing Upgrades 
- Bug Fixes (a few major ones)
- More Control over tabs.
- Printing support

And many more misc things!

All the details of the next release are in this [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.2-Coming-Soon).


**Release Date**
Currently, the plan is to release the next update the last week of the July around the 28th is the approx. Date. The next release will be a bug fixes update, but it is a important update, including printing support and other misc bug fixes. 

Failure to get the latest updates when they become available can force you to have to manually reinstall BB to get new features and improvments. 
 
**BeffsBrowser 2.1.0 is ready**

You will need to uninstall BeffsBrowser, and remove all data of BeffsBrowser before installing this update. 

P.S. Pin to task bar, otherwise you will have a hard time figuring out how to launch.
