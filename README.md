#Update!

*Coming soon!*

I have a few issues to work out and here is a start of this list:
- Flash Support
- Bug: Last tab close the window close
- Speed Issues
- other various bugs

Some features are leaving in version 1.5.1 and will be deemed decomissioned in version 1.5.0 read the details <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Decomissioned-Features-coming">here</a>

don't worry! No major features are leaving!

BeffsBrowser is a simple but outstanding browser, getting a upgrade, Version 2.0 will bring many improvements. One feature is the WebEditor, which can also be found in it's own project!
