# Archive Policy

A new Archive Policy has been published in the wiki, you can read it [here](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Archive-Policy)

*Simply Said Summary*

The new policy will reflect on effeciency in the open source community, providing a constructive policy pointing out what happens when you don't update. Support for older versions are removed every so often (everything is said in the wiki) - making outdated versions discontinued. 

In short, you should keep your application up to date with the latest version to avoid missing bug fixes and resolving issues which you may post about well after they are resolved with the next release.
