#Version 1.5.4 *Coming soon!*

*Final 1.5.0 Version*

A new version is now going into development with 1.5.3 released. I need to make sure users can install Version 1.5.3, before I begin working. With that in mind and the log list of items I am working on for this version, it could be as late as December before I finish with this release. 
See the full log on the next release <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.5.4">here</a>
#Version 1.5.3 

I am going to be doing a quick fix release sometime this week or next. This will be my only attempt in the short term future to deal with the .exe don't work bug, as I said in the issue, I really have no intentions on fixing it any time soon as long as the zip works. 

See the Log <a href = "https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-1.5.3-Bug-fixes-Patch-Release">Here</a>

The Patch Release may not be ready till next week. I have a few more things to do.
#Version 1.5.2 

To get the update you will need to get the zip the .exe will not work. see this <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/issues/3">issue</a> for details.
