**Early Release for V 2.0**

Pleased to announce I will start rapid development of V. 2.0 as soon as version 1.6.3 is released.

V2 will be pre-released as Version 1.6.4, and will wrap up V1 for this project. 

The Pre-Release will have bug fixes and finishing touches that will make a smoother transition into the new era of development. 

See An Overview of v1 in this [Wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Comparing-V1-to-V2:-A-V2-Journey.)

**New Release Schedule**

Releases will be mutually "Scheduled" on a set date each month to pan out a years of releases, to get us to V3. 

This plan will help BeffsBrowser mature - if a version will be delayed, or released early said date will be said.

# Announcment - License Changes

After a long consideration, I have decided to change the license to MIT, the switch will be seamless and info is found in the official [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/License-Changes-Effective-Version-1.6.2)

These Changes are effective as of 1.6.2 and are seamless.

#About

A Simple but powerful Browser!



# Open Source
Licensed under The MIT License

# System Requirements!

**As of Version 1.6.2 these are the latest system requirements**


*Minimum Requirements*

  - Windows 7 (XP OR VISTA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED!)

  - 200 MB of storage space + 1GB for data storage (See below for details)

  - 1GB of Ram
  
  
*Recommended*

Windows 7 or newer (Developed on Windows 8.1)

500 MB of storage space for the applications and keep around 1-2 GB free for data storage (Favorites, History etc)

1 GB of Ram or larger (I have 4GB on my machine so have at least that for best performance)

**Additonal Space may be required**

Depending on how many websites you save, how many sites you visit, and how often you clear that data, you will need to have  alittle more space open. 
I estimated so HIGH because, I simply can't predict how much you will use. It really varies, if you don't navigate a bunch or clear history regularly, then you will have no issues using less than 1mb of space for that data.

**Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported.**

These are both very old Window's Versions both of which are getting the plug pulled by Microsoft or already have. 

BeffsBrowser *may* work but it isn't guaranteed, as it uses a newer framework.
