# Announcments

**Prep for Extensions**

The release is taking an extra month to complete due to the addition of extensions, this mechanism will control v1 of the extesnions system in BeffsBrowser. API/SDK docs will be in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Extensions-SDK-API-V1)

The docs are not finished yet. And subject to change before release. 



**Version 2.3**

The Fall Update, Version 2.3, will be released in late September, early October. See the notes in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.3-Planning). Please understand they are subject to change and even mentioned to not be final. Currently everything listed is being tested or has been tested. A final draft of release notes will be released before the release of Version 2.3 


**Archive Policy**

A new Archive Policy has been published in the wiki, you can read it [here](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Archive-Policy)

*Simply Said Summary*

The new policy will reflect on effeciency in the open source community, providing a constructive policy pointing out what happens when you don't update. Support for older versions are removed every so often (everything is said in the wiki) - making outdated versions discontinued. 

In short, you should keep your application up to date with the latest version to avoid missing bug fixes and resolving issues which you may post about well after they are resolved with the next release. 


**Version 2.2.0 has been released!**

Please uninstall Version 2.1 before installing, should be the last time you have to manually uninstall.

**Arcade Feature is being depreciated!**

A Depreciation Life Cycle and the reason behind this is explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Depreciation-of-Arcade-Moving-BeffsBrowser-Forward)


**Version 2.2 Announcment**

Again I appologize in advance but Version 2.2.0 will need to be downloaded manually, and BB 2.1 will have to be uninstalled manually. After this time you will not have to manually uninstall anymore.

Expected release is Sometime in August, I will have more details soon!



**Version 2.2 will be coming soon!**

Development on the next release has begun, in the next release you will need to uninstall one last time, as I am switching to a professional version of the installer, provided for open source projects by Advance Installer. 

This should be the last time you will need to do this - after which you will be able to install updates.
