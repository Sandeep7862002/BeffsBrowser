# Announcments

**Version 2.3 has been released!**

Version 2.3 has a lot of fixes and improvments!

**Patch Upgrades**

After the 2.3 release, smaller releases will come about in-between the next version. So instead of 2.4, something like 2.3.1 will be released, which will include more minor adjustments and bug fixes. These are NOT "update" releases these are patches, so only new users will be obligated to have that version. 

During each Release, however, you will get those fixes in addition to whatever new features there is to offer. 

"Speed" Building is the concern, as the next major build of BeffsBrowser will not be due until June 2018. 

**BeffsMedia**

New feature coming soon! [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Media-Player-Beta)


**Archive Policy**

A new Archive Policy has been published in the wiki, you can read it [here](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Archive-Policy)

*Simply Said Summary*

The new policy will reflect on effeciency in the open source community, providing a constructive policy pointing out what happens when you don't update. Support for older versions are removed every so often (everything is said in the wiki) - making outdated versions discontinued. 

In short, you should keep your application up to date with the latest version to avoid missing bug fixes and resolving issues which you may post about well after they are resolved with the next release.
