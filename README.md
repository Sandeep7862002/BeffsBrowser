# Announcments

**Website Updates**

Over the next few weeks I am going to begin updating the website, and fix some issues with it being unresponsive on mobile devices. I already fixed an issue of the information it being for windows only. 


**Introducing the NEW BeffsBrowser Website!**

SSL + New domain!

https://beffsbrowser.org



Redesign and updates are coming as well!


**Testing Release along side stable release**

Version 2.4.2 has been released, the testing release isn't 100% ready and will be released tomorrow (5/12)




**Development Delays:**

*update* BeffsBrowser will get an update very soon to push the new updating mechanism, and much more! Sorry for the delays! 

The next release will be scheduled near the Beginning of April at the EARLIEST. This release is going to take extra time due to some of the new core features being added. 




**Version 2.4.0 has been released, 2.4.2 is undergoing development**

Version 2.4.2 will include much that wasn't included in 2.4.0, as well as a bunch of other new features and fixes. [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.4.2)



**Version 2.4.0 has began development**

There is more time for much of the todo list to be completed in 2.4.2, due to an installer issue the "installed" version will display as 2.4.1.

There is already a long to-do list, you can view that in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Version-2.4.0)

V. 2.4 is focused on making BB stable and more reliable as well as improvements and new features. 





**Version 2.3.2 has been released!**

This release was focused on many things, and is packed with features and updates that make BeffsBrowser more stable.

*Simply Said Summary*

The new policy will reflect on effeciency in the open source community, providing a constructive policy pointing out what happens when you don't update. Support for older versions are removed every so often (everything is said in the wiki) - making outdated versions discontinued. 

In short, you should keep your application up to date with the latest version to avoid missing bug fixes and resolving issues which you may post about well after they are resolved with the next release.
