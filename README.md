# Announcment - License Changes

After a long consideration, I have decided to change the license to MIT, the switch will be seamless and info is found in the official [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/License-Changes-Effective-Version-1.6.2)

These Changes are effective as of 1.6.2 and are seamless.

# Version 1.6.1

New Trouble Shooting [wiki] (https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser/wiki/Clearing-Data-and-restoring-data) Solution!
I got all of the items listed in the changelog except the Xbox controller support which will come around soon!

I am going to begin working on a new release and will be ready by early March, the main thing is to fix some annoying errors, address some bad practices, and add a app cache system - And I also want to add Xbox Controller support for some of the features within BeffsBrowser.

# System Requirements!

**As of Version 1.6.2 these are the latest system requirements**


*Minimum Requirements*

  - Windows 7 (XP OR VISTA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED!)

  - 200 MB of storage space + 1GB for data storage (See below for details)

  - 1GB of Ram
  
  
*Recommended*

Windows 7 or newer (Developed on Windows 8.1)

500 MB of storage space for the applications and keep around 1-2 GB free for data storage (Favorites, History etc)

1 GB of Ram or larger (I have 4GB on my machine so have at least that for best performance)

**Additonal Space may be required**

Depending on how many websites you save, how many sites you visit, and how often you clear that data, you will need to have  alittle more space open. 
I estimated so HIGH because, I simply can't predict how much you will use. It really varies, if you don't navigate a bunch or clear history regularly, then you will have no issues using less than 1mb of space for that data.

**Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported.**

These are both very old Window's Versions both of which are getting the plug pulled by Microsoft or already have. 

BeffsBrowser *may* work but it isn't guaranteed, as it uses a newer framework.
