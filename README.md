# Announcments
**Notice Feature was removed because of transition**

I removed the SSL Lock Feature for the time being - More information on the replacement will be released later. 

**Re-Release is ready!**

Since it was so minor, I simply removed the Old release.The new release solves the issue. 

**Happy Birthday to BB!**

Here is a [Birthday](https://jdc20181.github.io/BeffsBrowser/Birthday.html) Message from myself, celebrating BBs' 2nd birthday!


**New System Requirements**

These may be subject to change before the release, this is because the new browser engine has a few more dependencies than the old, so it is going to need a little more room to breathe.
