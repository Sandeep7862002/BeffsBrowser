# Light Browse a Light Browser for Light Browsing! 

Head on over to the [LightBrowse Respo](https://github.com/jdc20181/LightBrowse)! 



BeffsBrowser is a Light and Powerful Browser, but even though its light in size on your computer, it isn't light in features, 
with that said, a new project I have started called Light Browse will run right beside BeffsBrowser, it will feature, multi-Tabbed browsing
and not much else! 

Light Browse is a Independent Sub-Project of BeffsBrowser. There is little association of the two projects other than it being a lighter version 
of BeffsBrowser.

Favorites: Favorites is limited in LightBrowse, as it is thought if you want a lot of features you would use BeffsBrowser instead, and just not use 
the extras. The concept is Browsing only focused. 

Settings: Settings can help customize your experience, limited settings in light browse will mean, very minimal customizing, as with more settings
the app becomes bigger, which isn't the concept of the product. 

Minimum OS: Light Browse is starting with a Newer framework meaning compatibility to Windows 7 is limited, so I have decided not to support Windows 7 and older OS versions

StartPage: A New version of Startpage called LightPage, will work similar to Startpage without custom sites. You will have several quick sites to choose from.
