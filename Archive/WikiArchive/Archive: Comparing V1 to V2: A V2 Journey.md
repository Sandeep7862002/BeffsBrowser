# Overview look

Version 2.0 of BeffsBrowser will bring a obstacle of new challenges in developing a larger and more effecient product. The end goal is to keep maintaining this until I can no longer. Version 2 will start off quiet with a few new features and by 2.5 will be completely transformed into the "future" BeffsBrowser. 


Addressing Security - nothing bothers me more than outdated Browsers. In V1 I have added a Upgrading Tool that will automatically upgrade the engine to MS Edge if you are using Windows 10. I also have discontinued support for Windows XP  and Windows Vista, simply because these are unsupported by MS. I am going to continue to address security vulnerbilities if there are any, and fix them as soon as possible. Please note security aspects of this project will never be released to the public. Any bug or issue that could have a high risk impact is kept secret. 

Addressing Features Issues - In V1 there was a lot of unstable releases, it is a pain to program, and I am sure you have figured it out by now. The pain comes when dealing with releases you have to do a configuration that will compact all the neccessary files to a .exe, one mess up and it don't work. In V1, I switched over to InstallShield. Unstable releases had errors that were later resolved, thankfully now, BeffsBrowser is running smoothly. 

New Features that are useful - A lot of products exist on the web that stay on the web and become cross-platform, this is great unless you need a offline compatability. In v1 I have addressed this a many of a time limiting the features I add to ones that can be used while offline. Games, Utilities, and so much more. All at your fingertips. V2 will bring lots more features and enhancments that will make your browsing experience even better than ever before.

User Experience/Interface Enhancments - The New UI was something in V1 I am most proud to cherish, it was something I was wanting to do, and turned out successful. The User Experience is important, and a clean UI. The biggest issue I am still facing is how to compact all the features to easily be accessable without overdoing a UI, I did that by making individual UI's for each section. In v2 expect bigger and better things with this makeover. 

And so much more! - I truly thank anyone who has ever used my browser. I have been doing this project for 2 years. And before its release it was pre-released for about 6 months. I just didn't release it to the public. 

Much more is in store for V2, and we are just a few months a way from the kickoff of Version 2.0!
