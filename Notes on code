Explaining the source code is simple, stuff that isn't needed like buttons to features or other things of that nature isn't included it helps 
prevent unused code from casuing you errors. For the most part each button such as for Go forward back etc. are named some may not. 
Also the history window isn't shown it is basically just a listbox that writes each line saved in a history.txt file from settings not directly from the text file
so its like my.settings.history instead of history.txt it makes it easier to manage and later on a don't save history function will be available
