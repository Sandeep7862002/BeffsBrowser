*Work in Progress*

Will be Pre-Released soon! 




Some other notes:

Some features will be missing at the very beginning, this is because this is being built pretty well from the ground up.

During the initial release, only the browser itself will be included, simply this is because of stability testing etc.

You will notice design wise not much is different in early releases, but as the main releases of BB change so will this version. 

Updates will be less frequent than the main release. Doesn't mean they won't occur together e.g. 2 patches in a week, however it may be 2 months before a new release is ready. 

Bugs will occur during the beta period, because I am using a newer .net framework, and Chromium, it will be instable for a while, please understand this before using it, those who wish to get good use out of BB please use the main releases. 

Source Code offered will be minified, and will be only the core components, excluding unnecessary items e.g. Close window.
