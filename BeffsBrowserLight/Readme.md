**"Light" Version of BB Codename: BeffsBrowser Light**

Featuring:
Toggle History on or off - with it off nothing is saved data wise.

This will not come to main version of BB There is Private Browsing for this reason in BB this application will not have anything the main builds of BB have. This is simply because I want to provide an option to just simply browse freely. (open source browser part) without taking up space. Even though BB is light, some don't want those features, as you may want to use it in a business or other type setting.

This is all a WIP and will be released at a later date.
