Version 3 is now Planned to be named Krypto, while BeffsBrowser is not going anywhere, Version 3 will be in a new respo. 

Fullname: BeffsBrowser Krypto 

Key-Features: 

- Gecko Engine Upgrade

- FireFox Plugin Support BETA

- Downloads Manager BETA

- Better support for updates

- Improvements with features

- Document Uploading to the cloud BETA

- Themes BETA 

And so much more. 

Krypto is scheduled for early beta in the summer, with full release support this fall, but please note, not all features will be included initally, as this is a complete rebuild from the ground up. 

Now, with Krypto coming, what is happening to BeffsBrowser? 

Not much will happen, however the project file became corrupt, so updates will no longer happen once  Krypto is in full capacity to take over, BeffsBrowser will become a legacy version in the near future.
